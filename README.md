## yart | Yet another Rust texteditor
[![Made with Pain](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Pain-red.svg)](https://shields.io/) 

yart is a ***low productivity***, ***low fidelity***, ***low customizablity*** text editor that has its focus firm on ***user discomfort*** - specifically made for writing text (no way, right?).

### Features

- Written in Rust
- Thats all, I'm afraid...
